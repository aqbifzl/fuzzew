The purpose of this extension is to test the functionality of web applications. I want to achieve this by sending a combination of events and DOM modifications.
The extension is in early development, it is not ready for production.

My simplified TODO:
- Write tests
- Make it work with after a refresh
- Perhaps the whole structure could be improved
- Add an event logger to make debugging easier
- Error handling is definitely not perfect
